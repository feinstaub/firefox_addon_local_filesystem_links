      <h3>Additional information</h3>

      <div id="info">
        <p>
          In previous versions of Firefox (before FF 57) it was possible to access the
          local filesystem with the browser API. That's not supported anymore and it
          is similar to other browsers (e.g. Chrome has also this restriction).
        </p>
        <p>
          To make this extension possible we need a way to interact with the file system again.
          This is possible with a native application that can communicate with the browser with an API. It's called native messaging.
          The application will use the system file explorer (e.g. on Windows - it's Windows Explorer)
          to open the application in your linked application.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Whitelist needs to be according to new schema e.g. *://*.jsfiddle.net/*</h4>
      <p>The new format is &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;host&gt;&lt;path&gt; (wildcard char * is possible)<br/>
      A single * will be replaced with &lt;all_urls&gt; by the extension.
