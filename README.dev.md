local-filesystem-links DEVELOPMENT
==================================

Todos:

- [ ] add test folder + webserver for test cases (later, for now I'm starting the test server in a separate working copy)
- [ ] Icon adding not working properly
- [ ] Native message installer required (later, batch file for development OK)
- [ ] Check why native messaging is not working at the moment
- [ ] Create Extension settings page - options.html (uses Vue for view handling)
- [ ] Add "addon bar" icon to display activity of Extension on current tab
- [ ] Implement localization


Todos README:

- [ ] Remove everything jpm related
- [ ] Changed linting from gulp to eslint directly


# Usage
First run `npm install`.

## Start dev server for FF
`npm run dev:FF`

## Start firefox with webextension loaded
`npm start` to start web-ext start with dist folder.

Based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm

### Linux ###
The following instructions are for UNIXoid system which are all summarized by the term Linux.

***Install jpm***
```
npm install jpm
```
This will install jpm locally to node_modules/jpm/bin

Add jpm to PATH:
```
export PATH=`pwd`/node_modules/jpm/bin:$PATH
```

***Run unit tests.***
```
mkdir _pt           # once
jpm test -p ./_pt   # don't forget the ./
# or see https://github.com/mozilla/jpm/issues/287
jpm -b $(which firefox) test -p ./_pt
jpm -b ~/dev/share/firefox-42.0a1/firefox test -p ./_pt
```

--> Currently fails. See my comment on https://github.com/mozilla/jpm/issues/287
Also fails on freshly created addon via `jpm init`
So there is something very wrong.

***Build xpi***
Review package.json to have the correct version number.
And make sure it is a NEWER version:
see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIVersionComparator
(otherwise on AMO the new version is not accepted)

NEW, see https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/12/18/signing-firefox-add-ons-with-jpm-sign/:
```
jpm sign --api-key ${AMO_API_KEY} --api-secret ${AMO_API_SECRET}
```

OLD:
```
jpm xpi
```

Run:

```
jpm run -b $(which firefox)
```

see also start.sdk.sh

### Windows (discouraged) ###
If you haven't already, install appropriate Node.js version from https://nodejs.org/download/.

***Install jpm***

In Node.js command prompt:
```
npm install jpm -g
```

***Install npm dependencies***
`npm install`

If gulp is required globally use `npm install gulp -g`.

***Linting your code***
Running `gulp` will watch all js files and repeats linting on change.
With `gulp lint` you can do a one time lint.

***Run various jpm commands.***

Execute \start_sdk.cmd for convenient fast access to the most common jpm commands allowing you
to execute unit tests, run with debug window and create a xpi file.


Misc notes
----------
Run unit tests with nightly Firefox:
Download from https://nightly.mozilla.org/ and extract
Run jpm with -b option (see above)

Run test webserver and run firefox with the addon to do integration tests.
We need node to create a webserver because we cannot test properly with local websites.
```
cd test/webserver # because the node server definition uses relative paths
node test-server.nodejs.js
# show something like:
# Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8125/




CODING STYLE
------------
We follow w3schools.com's style guide and coding conventions, see http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp.

Additionally all pages are coded in order to conform with strict mode, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
We use JSDoc for documentation, see http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/wiki/DocExamples


WEB SERVER
----------
Used to verify some features, nodejs is required. See readme in \test\README.md for more information.

Webserver can be started by executing: \test\webserver\start_test_server.cmd

- Q: Why don't we use local html files?
- A: Because they are treated differently (compared to remotely served files) by Firefox


IDE HINTS
---------
